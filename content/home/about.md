# Biography

Terry Taewoong Um is a PhD candidate at University of Waterloo, who has extensive experience in robotics and machine learning fields. He researched on mobile manipulater during his master and developed a motion planning algorithm called [Tangent-space RRT](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-90-481-9262-5_27). He also involved in several power-assist exoskeleton projects at [LIG Nex1 corp.](https://www.lignex1.com/eng/product/product06.jsp) and [Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)](http://march.kist.re.kr/research.php). He has moved his research area from robotics to machine learning since 2013. After joining [Adaptive Systems Lab](https://pilots.uwaterloo.ca/adaptive-systems/) in 2014, he is focusing on applying deep learning techniques to human/robot motion data for, e.g., [exercise motion recognition]() and [Parkinson's disease evaluation](). He is also actively following state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and sharing his opinions through [twitter](https://twitter.com/TerryUm_ML)(English) and [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/terryum)(Korean).
